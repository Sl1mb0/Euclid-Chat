# __Euclid Chat__ 

Euclid Chat is a simple web application designed to encourage people 
from all walks of life engage with mathematics.

One of the biggest reasons people don't end up learning or pursuing math
is because they were never taught in a way that made sense to them, and
allowed them to have fun and play with the concepts.

Euclid Chat is designed to make math fun and social. This is meant to 
increase engagement with mathematics so that less people feel intimidated
by the subject.
